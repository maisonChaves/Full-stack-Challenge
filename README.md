# Full-stack-Challenge
Full-stack Challenge to Robos.in

I try develop a client and a server application. 

My Chatbot is named MaisonChavesBot.

## Server 

To build server, I pick Koa and MongoDB

Run, Build and Test

```command
npm start
npm run build
npm run test
```

Server can be seen on http://localhost:3000

## Client

To build client, I pick Webpack, Inferno and Bulma

Run, Build and Test

```command
npm start
npm run build
npm run test
```

Client can be seen on http://localhost:8080/ (main page) and http://localhost:8080/chats (chat page)

## Problems 

I could not finish the real-time functionality properly, I manage to broadcast and subscribe trow SSE specification, but I had issues with CORS headers.
